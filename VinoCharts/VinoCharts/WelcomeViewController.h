/*
 The WelcomeViewController displays the initial view that users will see whenever they turn on the app and are not signed in to a
 Dropbox account.
 
 The only transition from this view is to the AllProjectsViewController. User can do this by either syncing with a Dropbox account
 (which brings them to the AllProjects view after authentication is successful) or choosing to proceed without syncing a Dropbox
 account.
 
 This module uses a singleton instance of DBSesson which is provided by the Dropbox iOS SDK to verify the userâ€™s Dropbox account.
 
 There are no public methods in this module.
